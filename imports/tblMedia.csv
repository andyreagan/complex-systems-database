In it, they outlined the process of determining the saddest day in recent memory, the day Michael Jackson died using data culled from blogs. The happiest, they found, was November 4, 2008--the day Obama was elected. The paper's underlying concept dates back to 1881, when an Irish scientist conceived of an instrument called a  "hedonometer" that could measure the happiness of a population.@http://www.fastcodesign.com/multisite_files/codesign/imagecache/thumbnail/poster/2013/02/1671961-poster-1280-happy-cities-tweet-twitter.jpg@Fast Company

At schools of "communication", you'll generally find that neither the curriculum nor the faculty's research publications feature much if any analysis of speech and language. In other disciplines — sociology, social psychology, economics, history — you'll find even less of it. (The main systematic exception, Linguistic Anthropology, deserves a separate discussion — but the conclusion of such a discussion, I believe, would note a steep decline in empirical linguistic analysis.
