"Dimensional Analyses of the Lorenz '96 Model","We look at the Lorenz '96 model, which involves the coupling of fast-time and slow-time oscillators resulting in chaotic dynamics. We examine how the number of fast- and slow-oscillators effects the dynamics. For particular parameter choices, we find the existence of standing waves despite the expectation of a chaotic attractor."
"Human Mobility and Happiness on Twitter","We investigate the relationship between how people move around and how happy they are using Twitter. In addition, we add to the characterization of the shape of human mobility in general."
